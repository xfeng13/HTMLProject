<p class="heading"><b><font size="5">Be Prepared before the Course Begins</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,serif">Before the class begins, make sure you 
have adequate computer hardware, software and your system meets
the technology requirements. 
Make sure you have a regular place for study and a planned routine for 
accomplishing assignments. </font></p>
<p class="heading"><b><font size="5">CSE180 Online Classes are Structured</font></b></p>
<p>The course is organized as weekly folder, each weekly folder contains two 
modules. Unless specified, modules are due either on Tuesday or Thursday 11:59pm Arizona time 
of the week. 
It is important that you log into the course website at the start of the semester and print out a copy of the class 
schedule and follow the timeline closely. </p>
<p class="heading"><b><font size="5">Set aside Time to Study</font></b></p>
<p>Online courses take just as much study time as your face-to-face courses, 
especially for this 7.5 weeks course, <font face="Times New Roman,serif">it 
is much more concentrated and accelerated than a regular 15 weeks course! Be 
prepared </font>to spend at least  3-4 hours per day for the weekly submission 
folder.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="heading"><b><font size="5">Ability to be Self-Motivated</font></b></p>
<p>Since there is no class to attend, you will be free to work on your own 
schedule at anytime and anywhere you have an internet connection. Each weekly 
submission folder is made available to students at least two weeks ahead of its 
due date and you're 
encouraged to work ahead of the class schedule, but this freedom requires that 
you are motivated to complete your course work and submit it on time. It is 
highly recommended that you block out time each day to complete your assignments 
on time.</p>
<p class="heading"><b><font size="5">Read Carefully</font></b></p>
<p>Most of the course materials are in a written format, so read the course 
instruction and read it carefully are very important. Also, you're required to 
check the announcements posted on the course website on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="heading"><b><font size="5">Communication is key</font></b></p>
<p>You are not in a classroom where we (instructor or TA) can see if you have 
questions. Therefore, it is critical to communicate any questions or issues you 
have either through the discussion board or through emails. Feel free to 
post your questions on Discussion board and let us know immediately when you 
need help. Staying in touch with us can be a key to your success!</p>
