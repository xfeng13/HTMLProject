<p align="center" class="auto-style4">Discussion Board Etiquette</p>
<p><span class="auto-style1">These are general rules to be followed on our course Discussion Board forums 
as well as any other discussion boards you encounter on the web. Advanced users 
are aware of, and for the most part follow these rules. Web users who don't are 
often ignored and/or </span><span class="auto-style3">flamed </span>
<span class="auto-style1">(remember that Netlingo link from before?). 
We reserve the right to remove any posts that break these rules:</span></p>
<ol>
  <li class="auto-style1">Post new threads under the correct forum. </li>
  <li class="auto-style1">Do not post solutions to assignments and quizzes. </li>
  <li class="auto-style1">Before you ask a question&nbsp; (start a thread), be sure it hasn't already 
  been answered. First, read the assignment and course materials closely. Then, 
  read through the other threads to see if someone else has already asked the 
  question. </li>
	<li class="auto-style1">You can use the &quot;Search&quot; button on discussion board 
	to check whether the same question has been asked or not.</li>
  <li class="auto-style1">Make the subject of your post descriptive. To the extent that someone 
  reading your subject can readily determine if the thread is one they would 
  like to read. For example, do not use &quot;problem&quot; or &quot;help&quot; as a subject, 
  instead be more specific, i.e. &quot;Cannot log in to Secure Shell&quot;. </li>
  <li class="auto-style1">The body of your post should be direct and to the point. Keep it short and 
  include only relevant detail. </li>
  <li class="auto-style1">Do not write in ALL CAPS. It implies you are SHOUTING. </li>
  <li class="auto-style1">Do use proper grammar and spelling always. Everything you publish on the 
  web is a reflection of your abilities. Poor grammar, and the use of text 
  shortcuts, reflect poorly on you. </li>
  <li><span class="auto-style1">Only use formatting where appropriate (for instance, to distinguish a 
  copied/pasted error message from the rest of your text). However, keep special 
  formatting (bold, italics, etc.) to a minimum. Only use if necessary to make 
  the post more readable. Different font colors and sizes are rarely necessary 
  and often annoying (as are excessive punctuations).</span><br class="auto-style1">
&nbsp;<center>
  <p><span class="auto-style1">Follow the &quot;just</span> <font color="#800000">
  <span class="auto-style1">because </span> </font>
  <font face="Script"><span class="auto-style1">you</span></font> 
  <font color="#ff00ff" face="Stencil"><span class="auto-style2">can</span></font><span class="auto-style1">,

  </center></li>
  <li class="auto-style1">Above all, be polite and considerate to the faculty, staff, and your 
  fellow classmates. If you are joking, make it obvious. It is very easy to 
  misinterpret a post as negative or rude. It's ok to relax a little and enjoy 
  the communication, but do be aware of how your message sounds. It's always a 
  good idea to read back what you've written a couple of times to make sure it 
  came out the way you intended. </li>
  <li><span class="auto-style1">And finally ... </span>
  <span class="auto-style2">feel free to answer questions! </span>
  <span class="auto-style1">This is not a 
  faculty/staff Q&amp;A, this is a group forum where students can help each other. 
  Of course, remembering not to give away the solutions. We will monitor the 
  discussion boards and read everything posted, however, this is not a 24/7 
  surveillance. It's been my experience that during the times when faculty/staff 
  are unavailable, the students have done a tremendous job assisting each other 
  and I hope to see this continue. </span> </li>
