<p>If you see this message, it means your GitHub web hosting service is now active. You now see the default index.html file shown.</p>
<p>Please follow the instructions in Step #1 of the project description, submit your website address on Canvas, and then continue with Step #2.</p>
<p>In Step #2, you will replace the default contents of the website by rewriting the index.html file and uploading it to your repository.</p>
</br>
Please be patient, as it may take 5-10 minutes for the updated index.html file to appear correctly on your website.
